### :mag_right:  Research objective:

build a model to determine the price of a car, it's important to take into account the quality of prediction (RMSE metric < 2500), prediction speed, training time

### 	:notebook:  Result:

5 regression models were considered, based on the speed of the model and the quality of the prediction, one was chosen - `DecisionTreeRegressor`, RMSE on test data =2005 and on validation data =1957

### :hammer_and_wrench:  Tools:

`Pandas`, `Sklearn`, `Xgboost`, `Lightgbm`

exploratory data analysis, data visualization, regression models, gradient boosting
